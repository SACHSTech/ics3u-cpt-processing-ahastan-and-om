# Bettor's Haven

Sports betting has been one of the most lucrative industries for years now. Basketball betting is a major part of this. Many bettors take to online forums to bet on players points, rebounds, assists, shooting percentages etc. However, despite the popularity in basketball betting, there is no single website or app that allows bettors to access both the individual statistics of the players, and advice of the so called “experts” or “gurus”. Our program, (name), will allow the users to access the individual statistics of every NBA team’s starting five players, as well as our individualized advice for each and every one of them. The statistics include points, rebounds, assists, shooting percentages, and turnovers.  This allows the users to view the statistics of their favourite players in an organized manner, as well as be up to date on the situations of different teams. This is something that would greatly benefit bettors, as they tend to lose money due to not being organized in their processes. The advice is broken down into three parts. First, it includes the team’s overall situation, such as their records and injury situations. Then, it would go into the best individual players to bet on, and lastly, the team would receive a “betting level” rating from very poor to very good based on their odds to make the playoffs or even win the NBA championship. The only limitation of the program is that we are unable to receive input from users about their emails or contact information, in order to receive updates about the specific players. However, the program highly promotes organized sports betting, as well as the insight of the experts of the industry, making it unique and highly useful. It is also very easy to navigate through.
